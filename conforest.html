Coniferous Forests of California
    </h1>
    <p> Coniferous forests are forests consisting of evergreen conifers or cone-bearing trees. A few examples of these trees include junipers, firs, cypress, cedars and the california redwood, also known as sequoia sempervirens. Theyre the largest living trees and are endemic to the foggy coastal range from Southwest Oregon to Central California, USA. Theyre considered old-growth forests and the first redwood trees appeared over 240 million years ago with the current oldest living redwood being 2,500 years old. due to their unique combination of high humidity, low temperatures, and vastness, these forest's foliage provides the perfect habitat for many small species like worms, scorpions, amphibians, beetles and spiders.
